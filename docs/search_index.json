Although there are many varieties of this drink, it is not really known what causes the advantage of some wines over others. In this paper, we have looked at this issue by a fresh look at the Red Wine Quality from Kaggle comunity dataset 1. Much to our initial surprise, despite the fact that a dozen or so chemical factors were taken into account, there is one that strongly goes through the series and seems to be the main predictor of the drinks assessment by experts - it is alcohol. The study used four black box models interpreted through modern methods of explainable artificial intelligence. 1.4.2 Introduction and Motivation Interpretation of the glass boxs models is by definition simple. The case is completely different in the case of the black box models. There are many projects on the Internet that look at Red Wine Quality dataset from both perspectives, but it is different when it comes to using and interpreting these more advanced methods. The idea of this chapter is to compile XAI solutions in terms of the analysis of the above-mentioned valuable dataset, together with the confrontation with the previous research on the quality of red wine. 1.4.3 Methodology 1.4.3.1 Dataset The original collection contains 1 600 observations, each representing one portuguese Vinho Verde of the red variety. It is a proper to analyze and respected set, as evidenced by its verification, multiple use, as well as a very high rating of usability of 8.8 on the website. It consists of eleven predictors: fixed acidity - most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily) volatile acidity - the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste citric acid - found in small quantities, citric acid can add freshness and flavor to wines residual sugar - the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, its rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet chlorides - the amount of salt in the wine free sulfur dioxide - the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion total sulfur dioxide - amount of free and bound forms of S02 density - the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content pH - describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic) sulphates - a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant alcohol - the percent alcohol content of the wine The decision variable was originally quality - the average rating of experts who made their classification on a scale from 0 to 10. Due to the capabilities of the analyzed XAI tools, our team decided to make it shallow to the binary dimension - transforming the wines of rating &lt;= 5 to 0, while the others - to 1. Thie division resulted in a simple intuition of bad / good wine, which resulted in 855 good wines and 744 bad wines. 1.4.3.2 Machine learning algorithms used In order to look at the nature of this data, four well-known algorithms have been trained TODO: opisz je 1.4.4 Results TODO: po podrozdziale na kad metod; po kilka wykres√≥w i par-kilkanacie zda 1.4.5 Summary 1.4.6 Conclusions 1.4.7 References 1Red Wine Quality dataset: simple and clean practice dataset for regression or classification modelling https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009 "]]
